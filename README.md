# Summary

The AHA Soi Treebank is a small treebank for contemporary Soi. Its corpus is collected and annotated manually. We have prepared this treebank based on interviews with Soi speakers.


# Introduction

Soi treebank consist of 10 sentences of this stage. We are trying to make this corpus bigger day by day.
AHA is a small group, tries to analyze Iranian language and find their similarities and differences.


# Acknowledgments

Theses sentences were prepared with the help of Delijan people.

First, we used the sentences suggested by APLL (Academy of Persian Language and Literature) to collect Iranian languages.

This project is a research project by AmirHossein, Hamid and Amir (AHA).
